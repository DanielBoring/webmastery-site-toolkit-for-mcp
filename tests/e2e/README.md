# Ability Contract and Full MCP E2E QA

For the full repository QA posture, including static checks, unit tests, release checks, and GitHub Actions trigger policy, see [`docs/qa-strategy.md`](../../docs/qa-strategy.md).

The Docker QA suite has two layers:

1. Ability Contract QA is ability-driven. Every registered `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` ability must be represented in `tests/e2e/abilities-manifest.json`.
2. Full MCP E2E QA uses real MCP Adapter HTTP JSON-RPC requests against `/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server` to prove a remote MCP client can create, read, update, and delete content through the adapter transport.

Current coverage is 75 base registered abilities plus 5 generated abilities per eligible custom post type. The E2E runner registers two fixture custom post types, so the manifest covers 85 abilities (see the manifest validation script's runtime summary for the current test case count), including custom post type discovery and CRUD permission coverage for two capability maps, object/status-aware post, page, CPT, media, and SEO score list filtering, private-status and bulk-publish denial cases, sensitive identity-field absence checks, taxonomy get/update permission coverage, post and page listing response-shape assertions, expanded Yoast and SEOPress metadata write coverage, controlled Google Site Kit status/module/permission/PageSpeed route fixtures with shared-dashboard, denial, privacy, and same-site URL coverage, the bulk post abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/bulk-trash-posts` and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/bulk-publish-posts`, the revision abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-revisions` and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/restore-revision`, the post meta abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-post-meta`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/update-post-meta`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/delete-post-meta`, the block editing abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-content-blocks`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/patch-content-block`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/patch-post-content` with targeted post, page, CPT, permission-denial, and unsupported-type coverage, the comment interaction abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/reply-comment` and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/update-comment`, the media sideload ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/upload-image`, the content hygiene abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-orphaned-media`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-posts-no-featured-image`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-stuck-scheduled`, the site introspection abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-site-info`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-user-info`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-environment-info`, the user access audit ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/user-access-audit`, the Yoast score and metadata abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-seo-scores`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-readability-scores`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-yoast-metadata`, the SEOPress metadata ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-seopress-metadata`, the webmaster verification ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/webmaster-verification-status`, the database health ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/database-health`, the performance status ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/performance-status`, the backup status ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/backup-status`, plus the plugin abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-plugins`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/plugin-audit`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/activate-plugin`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/deactivate-plugin`.

`update-cpt-mcp-book` regression coverage (issue #107) proves taxonomy assignment is pre-validated before `wp_update_post()` writes anything: each denial case (a nonexistent taxonomy, a registered taxonomy the actor lacks `assign_terms` capability for, and a mixed payload combining one allowed and one forbidden *registered* taxonomy alongside the existing allowed-plus-nonexistent case) submits a full `title`/`content`/`status`/`slug`/`taxonomy_terms` payload, and the paired read confirms the fixture's title, content, status, slug, and taxonomy terms are all unchanged. A second fixture taxonomy, `wstm107_restricted_shelf`, is registered only for `mcp_book` and granted to no role, so it is always forbidden and exercises the mixed allowed/forbidden registered-taxonomy path independently of the nonexistent-taxonomy case. The fixture post used for these cases (`wstm107_book_id`) is created with an explicit, deterministic slug so the unchanged-slug assertions are stable.

## Rule for new abilities

When a PR adds a new ability, it must also add at least one manifest test case for that ability. If the ability is registered but missing from the manifest, E2E QA fails.

For abilities with role or capability restrictions, include both:

1. A positive case for a role that should be allowed.
2. A negative case for a role that should be denied.

For security-sensitive abilities, also include any assertions needed to prove the response does not leak data. Examples include `assert_missing_paths` for login names, emails, backend versions, protected metadata, private/trash totals, or other fields that lower-privilege users must not see. `composer validate:security-qa` enforces the current high-risk permission-hardening cases that protect against regressions like the WordPress.org review findings fixed in PR #90.

## What CI checks

`scripts/e2e-test.sh contract` runs `tests/e2e/ability-runner.php`, which:

1. Creates deterministic WordPress fixtures.
2. Installs and activates the MCP Adapter, Yoast SEO, and SEOPress plugin dependencies.
3. Reads `tests/e2e/abilities-manifest.json`.
4. Gets the currently registered abilities from `wp_get_abilities()`.
5. Fails if any registered `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` ability is missing from the manifest.
6. Fails if the manifest references an ability that is not registered.
7. Executes every manifest case through `wp_get_ability()->execute()`.
8. Supports positive assertions, negative assertions, missing-path assertions for sensitive fields, post meta assertions, and post thumbnail assertions.
9. Writes `e2e-artifacts/e2e-summary.json` with coverage and result counts.

`scripts/e2e-test.sh e2e` runs `tests/e2e/mcp-crud-runner.php`, which:

1. Creates temporary Application Password credentials for the existing E2E editor and subscriber users.
2. Initializes real MCP HTTP sessions against the MCP Adapter default server.
3. Verifies `tools/list` exposes the `mcp-adapter-execute-ability` gateway.
4. Discovers this plugin's post CRUD abilities through `mcp-adapter-discover-abilities`.
5. Calls `mcp-adapter-execute-ability` over HTTP JSON-RPC to create, read, update, and trash a real draft post.
6. Confirms a subscriber write attempt is denied through the MCP transport.
7. Writes `e2e-artifacts/mcp-crud-summary.json` with protocol-level CRUD result counts.

## Local QA entry points

### Bounded image-download evidence

The contract phase also runs `media-download-runner.php` directly with PHP (not `wp eval-file`). Both this runner and `media-http-server.php` reject non-CLI access before arguments or WordPress bootstrap. They start an owned ephemeral loopback HTTP fixture and produce `media-download-fixed.json` and `media-server-fixed.jsonl`; contract CI retains these alongside its summary for seven days. Required evidence-write failures fail the runner.

The runner routes a syntactically public IPv4 URL to its own local fixture **only in test hooks**, preserving production safe URL checks, redirects, core write callbacks, and actual cURL/Fsockopen transports. This proves bounded storage and early cancellation, not public DNS/network isolation. The manifest's `pre_http_request` mocks instead prove permission/metadata/error contracts and bypass core network validation; its media URLs use a mocked public literal so an unresolvable test hostname is not silently accepted. Resolver unit tests use subclass-only seams, never remotely controllable filters.

Cases cover oversized, missing/dishonest Content-Length, chunked and compressed responses, exact/under-limit images, generic/wrong Content-Type, featured metadata, redirects, non-200 responses, MD5 failures, incomplete HTTP bodies, short PNG headers, timeout, tempfile/sideload failures, object/capability denials, invalid limits, subsequent requests on reused transports, nested unrelated requests, and pre-existing same-path stream preservation. Rejection checks compare attachment counts, featured-image state, temporary paths, and open output streams.

Client progress counts and peak file bytes are separate from the server's successful socket writes (not a claim of client receipt). Native cancellation permits chunk/socket buffering overshoot. Compressed cURL input may expand into several decoded callbacks before cancellation, but file storage is still clamped to `max + 1`; Fsockopen stores encoded bytes without a new decompression stage. Do not infer a CPU quota or complete image integrity from these tests.

For local baseline reproduction, activate an isolated copy of the baseline plugin in the disposable stack and run this **same runner** with `baseline`; reactivate the working plugin and run with `fixed`. The baseline mode records behavior and requires an observed over-limit download; only fixed mode enforces the corrected assertions. Preserve both JSON/log sets and their source/runner hashes outside the disposable container before cleanup. Baseline mode is not a passing security regression gate.

Each row retains `policy_passed` under the same assertions in both modes. Baseline `passed` reports cleanup/reproduction harness status separately; `policy_failed` reports the old behavior's failures, and `skipped` explicitly lists invalid-limit scenarios not exercised on the baseline. `peak_temp_bytes` measures the root download; `all_temp_peak_bytes` can include an intentionally unbounded, unrelated nested `download_url()` call. An earlier, same-URL streamed nested request is injected from an ordinary HTTP argument filter to verify root identification before nesting.

Small chunked PNGs succeed through cURL at their exact decoded limit. Fsockopen already cannot sideload the chunk-framed bytes; at an exact decoded-image limit it now reports `file_too_large` because framing counts toward that transport's stream limit, and with spare room it still reports `unsupported_mime_type`. This is not a newly rejected previously successful Fsockopen upload. `WSTM_MEDIA_WP_ROOT` can select another verified disposable core tree for CLI compatibility evidence; it is not used by production.

The labeled `limit-error-after-success` case is cleanup-only fault injection, not cancellation evidence: a trusted test hook deliberately disables cURL cancellation and replaces its completed file with a valid small PNG. It verifies that an already-observed overflow still returns an error and deletes the successful core return path, including a filename changed by core.

For quick local checks that do not require WordPress, run:

```bash
composer validate:e2e-manifest
composer validate:security-qa
```

These commands validate manifest JSON structure, required fields, allowed roles, expected result values, labels, assertion shapes, required security-sensitive coverage, and risky static permission callback patterns. They cannot replace full E2E coverage because they do not bootstrap WordPress or compare the manifest to `wp_get_abilities()`.

For both Docker layers, use a disposable Compose project with automatically assigned host ports. In Bash:

```bash
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="webmastery-qa-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM"
export MYSQL_PORT=0 WORDPRESS_PORT=0
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 bash scripts/e2e-test.sh all
```

Use `contract` or `e2e` instead of `all` for a single layer. For an already-running disposable stack, keep its `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and omit `E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1`.

Set `E2E_KEEP_COMPOSE=1` when you want to leave the containers running for debugging.

Use a unique `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` for disposable validation, especially on a shared machine. The runner manages only that project; do not point automatic cleanup at an existing development stack.

The E2E bootstrap installs Yoast SEO from WordPress.org with the `wordpress-seo` slug and SEOPress from WordPress.org with the `wp-seopress` slug because SEO abilities and assertions cover both providers. Set `YOAST_PLUGIN_SLUG` or `SEOPRESS_PLUGIN_SLUG` only when testing against a specific compatible package. It also installs `tests/e2e/site-kit-fixture.php` as a controlled must-use plugin so Site Kit route and response changes fail deterministically without requiring Google account credentials.

The runner fails early if either dependency is not active. Coexistence assertions seed SEOPress meta on a post that receives Yoast-backed updates and verify those Yoast paths do not mutate SEOPress meta; separate SEOPress assertions verify SEOPress-specific write and read paths.

Routine QA uses reviewed WP-CLI, MCP Adapter, SEO-plugin, and Plugin Check pins from `.github/compatibility-versions.json`. WP-CLI and adapter downloads must pass digest verification before execution/installation. Candidate overrides must supply the matching digest; do not reuse the baseline digest for a different release. The scheduled compatibility workflow explicitly opts into floating dependencies and records the versions it actually tests.

Set `MCP_CRUD_ENDPOINT` only when you need the secondary CRUD runner to target a non-default MCP Adapter endpoint. By default it uses `http://localhost/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server` from inside the WordPress container.

PowerShell users can run:

```powershell
$env:COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME = "webmastery-qa-$([guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N').Substring(0, 12))"
$env:MYSQL_PORT = '0'
$env:WORDPRESS_PORT = '0'
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Contract
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -E2E
```

Unix, macOS, and Git Bash users can run:

```bash
scripts/qa-local.sh --contract
scripts/qa-local.sh --e2e
```

## PR comment coverage summary

The E2E PR comment includes:

- registered `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` ability count
- manifest-covered ability count
- manifest test case count
- negative permission case count

These counts make it visible when an enhancement adds new ability coverage.

Full E2E artifacts also include `mcp-crud-summary.json` for the secondary protocol-level CRUD QA phase.

GitHub Actions retains available JSON summaries on successful runs as well as failures, with bounded retention. Fork/read-only bot PRs use job summaries without requiring a write token for comments. `Docker QA gate` accepts skipped Docker jobs only when successful change detection explicitly identifies a non-runtime change.
